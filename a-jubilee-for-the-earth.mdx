**Our Planet Earth**

**\_Editor’s note:** \_This series takes a deeper look at Pope Francis’ 2015 encyclical ― On Care for
Our Common Home, Laudato Si’\_\_

Did you know that in 2015, Pope Francis published an encyclical On Care for Our Common
Home “Laudato Si’?” An encyclical is one of the highest forms of communication by a pope and
usually deals with some aspect of Catholic teaching. “Laudato Si’” is an appeal for “every person
living on this planet” to enter into dialogue with him on the future of our Mother Earth.

He calls all to acknowledge the urgency of our environmental challenges, and join him with hope
and determination. Sept. 1 is celebrated annually as the World Day of Prayer for the Care of
Creation, beginning the Season of Creation that ends on Oct. 4, the feast day of Saint Francis of
Assisi. Pope Francis describes the 2020 Season of Creation as a “Jubilee for the Earth.”
This series of columns aims to help readers understand and take to heart Pope Francis’ wisdom
from his Earliest Notes (Nos. 1-16) in “Laudato Si’.” They put into practice Pope Francis’ truths.
But first, an open mindset is necessary.

Let our hearts and eyes be open to seeing the real changes our planet is going through with
wildfires, storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts and floods – and how we as stewards can help
encourage, inspire and advocate more for its well-being. A great YouTube video to watch is
Love Song to the Earth (3:48 minutes) by Dominican Sister Michelle Sherliza. Visit
YouTube.com and search Michelle Sherliza to find the video.

Pope Francis speaks about our Mother Earth and, frankly, how foolish we’ve been in the use of
our air, water and land. The first Earth Day was 50 years ago, and the last six popes have shown
great concern for our planet. In the mid-1900’s, environmental conditions in the United States
were so horrendous that the federal government passed the National Environmental Policy Act.
What a blessing it has been!

St. Francis of Assisi is a blessing, too – the patron saint of ecology. He believed every creature
was a sister, mother or brother united to him by bonds of affection. In his message for the Sept. 1
World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation, Pope Francis said that it is a time to remember all
things are connected; a time to return love and care to our Mother Earth; a time for us to rest and
rediscover life; a time to restore air, water and land; and a time to rejoice. “ … if we no longer
speak the language of fraternity and beauty in our relationship with the world, our attitude will be
that of masters, consumers, ruthless exploiters, unable to set limits on their immediate needs”
(Laudato Si’ 11).

The question is: Will we heed the call and enter into dialogue with Pope Francis?
