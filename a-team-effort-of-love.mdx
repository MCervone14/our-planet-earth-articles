**Our Planet Earth**

**Editor’s note:** _This series takes a deeper look at Pope Francis’ 2015 encyclical ― On Care for
Our Common Home, Laudato Si’_

Did you know that in 1970, President Richard Nixon signed the National Environmental Policy
Act, which required some federal agencies to take part in certain regulations, policies, projects,
licensing, and permitting? The NEPA has been a blessing for 50 years because it requires
projects to realize their impacts on the environment, and be held accountable. It was developed
to avoid, minimize, and mitigate/lessen our impacts upon Earth’s air, water and soil.

In some larger projects, NEPA has even required millions of trees to be planted, preserved in
place, and protected forever, along with avoidance and protection of many other human and
natural resource issues. As Christians around the world committed to enriching the lives of
others through our faith and humanitarian aid, how can we find a loving balance in humanity and
nature,and a sustainability of goodwill towards our Mother Earth for another 50 years?

We urge you to take to heart Pope Francis’ wisdom from Chapter 1 of “Laudato Si’” – “What is
Happening to our Common Home?” Pope Francis calls all people in the world to discover ways
to protect nature and “Save our Planet Earth.”

Our world is a precious gift given to us by God, and we oversee its health. But to do this,
questions arise. Among them:

- How can we be heroes to our Mother Earth following Pope Francis’ encyclical and fully
  take to heart our earthly actions?
- What are the best practices to reduce greenhouse gases and for us to become carbon
  neutral, so we can breathe better and not witness so many devastating storms and
  wildfires?
- How can we participate in a Climate Action Plan and implement it while also meeting
  carbon-neutral goals like greater use of clean renewable energy forms, protecting and
  promoting biodiversity, and guaranteeing clean water to all?
- How can we set aside ways in our own lives to care for our common home, our Mother
  Earth, one day at a time?

In 1962, Rachel Carson wrote the book “Silent Spring,” which urged humans to act responsibly,
carefully and in haste. It left an indelible mark on the concept of reducing pollution. In 1965,
Adlai Stevenson, then the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, said, “We travel
together, passengers on a little spaceship, dependent on its vulnerable resources of air, water, and
soil, for our safety, to its security and peace as preserved from annihilation only by the care, the
work, and the love we give our fragile craft.” In 2018, a young 15-year old Swede named Greta
Thunberg inspired millions in an international movement to fight climate change.

Today, we encourage agencies, universities, scientists, engineers, companies, farmers, teachers,
and others to resolve climate change, consumerism, pollution, global warming and urban sprawl.
Working with Pope Francis, let’s care for and protect our Mother Earth as we would a brother or
sister. As good people with endless potential, possibilities, and heart, let’s empower humankind
to act with urgency, love and support for our Mother Earth. To do this, though, we need
everyone – including you! We need your wisdom, strengths, compassion and dedication so we
can follow the moral compass that proclaims, “Do no harm!”
