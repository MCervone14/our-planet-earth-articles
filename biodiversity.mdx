**Our Planet Earth**

**Author’s note:** _This worldwide website encourages, inspires, and informs citizens to act now, and to practice
ecological principles in our journey “On Care for Our Common Home.”_

**Introduction**

Biodiversity includes richness or the number of species, including the identity, dominance, and rarity of these
species. Did you know the [main driver in the loss of biodiversity remains in humans’ use of land primarily for food
production](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/biodiversity) with humans altering over 70% of all ice-free land? When land is converted for agriculture or
development, animals and plants lose their habitat. We, as stewards and ambassadors of planet Earth, need to avoid
destroying natural habitats.

The _London School of Economics and Political Science_ says, “Currently, species are disappearing 10 to 1,000 times
faster than the normal ‘background’ rate of extinction. All this suggests that we have entered the ‘6th mass extinction
event,’ the first in Earth’s history to be driven primarily by human activity.” _Inside Climate News_ reported [more than
half of bird species in the United States are in decline](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22102022/whats-good-for-birds-is-good-for-people-and-the-planet-but-more-than-half-of-bird-species-in-the-u-s-are-in-decline/).

A recent study in _Nature Climate Change_ reported [scientists found 65% of insect populations they examined
could go extinct over the next century](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3231/climate-change-can-put-more-insects-at-risk-for-extinction/), while _Harvard University_ reported, “[over-exploitation, agriculture, and
development have been the primary culprits in the dramatic loss of biodiversity](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2020/losing-ground/), which, when compounded by
the effects of climate change, stand to wreak further havoc.”

Biodiversity gives balance to nature, but when this balance is disrupted, the stability of an ecosystem could be in
jeopardy. “Scientists generally agree that as the number of species in any particular type of ecological system declines,
that [system can potentially lose its ability to rebound](https://www.epa.gov/report-environment/diversity-and-biological-balance).” _National Geographic_ reported [deforestation is leading to more human infectious diseases](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/deforestation-leading-to-more-infectious-diseases-in-humans).

In addition, biodiversity supports a healthy food chain. When lack of diversity causes elimination of parts of the food
chain, it can ultimately mean the collapse of that chain, which could mean possible starvation for many animals,
including humans.

In the Amazon, the world’s largest reservoir of biodiversity, [2/3’s of the species have lost habitat to fire and
deforestation](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/01092021/amazon-rainforest-biodiversity-deforestation-fires/), and in a report from _Inside Climate News_ found up to [80% of threatened animal and plant species have
had their habitat damaged by mining, agriculture or logging](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/14032018/climate-change-species-at-risk-biodiversity-plants-animal-migration-global-warming/).

## What Can You Do?

**Protect Rainforests** - The Amazon and other rainforests provide so many benefits essential to life on Earth.
“Not only do they provide air, water, medicine, food, and shelter to a multitude of living beings, they are also
one of our [best natural defenses against climate change](https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/everyday-actions/9-rainforest-facts-everyone-should-know/) because of their capacity to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.” In addition, [rainforests cool the planet, and essentially act as air conditioners](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070409181831.htm) for the world.

**Outdoor Spaces** - Manage your property as a park by planting trees, flowers, gardens, and developing habitat
for pollinators and other wildlife. To help, [add diversity to your landscape, plant native species, reduce use of
pesticides/herbicides, and limit outdoor lighting](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/earth-systems/the-insect-effect/). Lighting should be directed downward to eliminate sky glow,
and you can reduce lighting by using motion detectors.

**Community Planning**- Municipalities should use Geographic Information System mapping for their planned
growth needs. Avoiding and minimizing impacts to environmentally sensitive habitats is a must, and cities
should not resort to urban sprawl. Conversely, they should use existing disturbed habitats, and avoid, minimize,
or mitigate impacts.
