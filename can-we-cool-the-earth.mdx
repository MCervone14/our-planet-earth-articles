Did you know the TV show “Highway to Heaven” produced many episodes about the
environment? Merry Christmas from Grandpa (1989; Season 5/Episode 13) aired 33 years ago.
It’s significant because many issues then －exist today. Similarly, Katharine Hayhoe, Ph.D., had
a great video entitled “The most important thing you can do to fight climate change” (12/14/18).

PBS/NOVA aired “Can we cool the Earth” (Ben Kalina, 10/22/20). Experts agree the first step
for cooling the planet is preventing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and other greenhouse gases from
entering the atmosphere. This documentary addressed a combination of seven methods:

- direct air capture
- recycling emissions
- using carbon in making materials
- marine-cloud brightening
- release of fine particle aerosols in the stratosphere
- preservation, reforestation and afforestation
- composting on grasslands and soils

**Direct air capture** works on a small-scale; is very expensive; and requires much water to eject
and store carbon into the earth. **Recycling emissions** uses sunlight, ambient air, and water vapor
to drive a reaction capable of flying a large jet, but it costs six times normal fuels. **Using carbon
in making materials** is good for concrete companies to reduce CO 2 emissions. Incorporating
CO 2 into concrete with fly ash makes for durable concrete. **Marine-cloud brightening** adds
small saltwater particles to generate clouds, which act as floating sun reflectors. **Release of fine
particle aerosols into the stratosphere** reflects sunlight too.

Natural ways of capturing CO~2 from the atmosphere are **preservation** of existing forests, and
**reforestation and afforestation** of 2.5 billion acres worldwide “outside urban and farming
areas.” For a 3-D worldwide carbon profile, a Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation
instrument is needed on one of our satellites. It would help us know where to save our carbon
sources and where to invest in new carbon sources. Using **compost** layered on grassland and
farmland is another way to increase plant growth 78% and soil carbon 37% in 3 years (Ben
Kalina, “Can we cool the Earth,” PBS/NOVA).

Biogas is produced when food or animal wastes are broken down by microorganisms in the
absence of oxygen. An example of a biogas is methane from landfills (“Your trash is emitting
methane in the landfill. Here’s why it matters for the climate,” Bruggers et al., 7/13/21, NPR).
Methane is more than 25 times stronger than CO 2 at trapping heat in the atmosphere (EPA,
6/9/2022). Air travel is another source of  air pollution . (“New Concept hybrid planes could
reduce deadly air pollution by 95%,” Tiffany Duong, 2/12/21, EcoWatch).

Consider joining Dr. Douglas Tallamy to learn how small actions by individuals can
make a big environmental impact (University of Evansville, Ridgway University Center,
Eykamp Hall, 6-9 p.m. Oct. 1). Free tickets are available at:

Tri-State Creation Care will host Evansville’s first-ever Electric Vehicle ride-and-drive, “EVs for
EVV,” from 4-7 p.m. CT Oct. 2, in the parking lot between Michael&#39;s and Arby&#39;s at the NW
corner of the Lloyd Expressway and Burkhardt Road.
