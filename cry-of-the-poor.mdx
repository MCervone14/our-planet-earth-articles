Introduction

Have you ever been without water or food? Have you ever been homeless? Have you ever had little to no
money? Well, many people have －which makes them vulnerable, anxious, and in dire need of help. Many poor
people even need to migrate to new countries and find new places to live.

[The World Bank](https://www.worldvision.org/sponsorship-news-stories/global-poverty-facts) says there are about 9.2% of the world living on less than $2.15 a day, and in the United
States, 11.6% of the population lived in poverty as of 2021. Last August, in front of a crowd of 500,000 people
gathered in Lisbon, Portugal, [Pope Francis led a chant of &quot;Todos, todos, todos.&quot; &quot;Everyone! Everyone!
Everyone!&quot;](https://www.globalsistersreport.org/columns/todos-todos-todos-it-will-take-all-us?) &quot;There is space for everyone.&quot; Cry of the poor is a social and environmental issue.

“[The poor continue to be conveniently forgotten or ignored](https://laudatosiactionplatform.org/listening-to-the-cry-of-the-poor/) at the high table of world affairs. There exists an
amnesia of the poor on the part of the rich and powerful minority elite who are at the helm of world economy
and politics.” They further purport how we can respond to the groaning of the poor and creation. One response
is for the faithful to marshal spiritual resources, e.g., scripture and social teachings. Hunger, migration, and
climate change are huge respect-for-life issues (Caroline Nellis, per. com.)

St. John Chrysostom said: Not to enable the poor to share in our goods is to steal from them and deprive them
of life. The goods we possess are not ours, but theirs (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2446). St. Teresa of
Calcutta is well-known for helping the poor. Mother Teresa, awarded the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize, dedicated her
life to the sick and hungry. [Her simple message was “the poor must know that we love them.”](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1979/teresa/documentary/) Let’s welcome all
children of God as shown in the [Global Sisters Report](https://www.globalsistersreport.org/news/opening-us-mexico-wall-aid-groups-welcome-strangers) where asylum-seekers are welcomed by Good
Samaritans. Humanitarian aid is never a crime.

## What Can You Do?

**Become More Active in the Legislative Process** - Develop a sensitivity to recognizing many people are poor
from how mankind has treated the Earth. A solution is to become more active in regulations like the Federal
Action in 1994 that addressed [Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations](https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-executive-order-12898-federal-actions-address-environmental-justice) as
signed by President William J. Clinton. It was a landmark order that brought environmental protection for all
communities.

**Fund Charitable Organizations** - There are many reputable organizations we can select in helping the poor.
Do what you can to help them live a life of purpose, so they can be citizens of a country that truly believes in its
people, and loves to share each others talents and resources.

**Support Steps for the Poor to Help Others** - The poor have a multitude of abilities that can individually and
collectively help society. Be aware of these assets, and welcome the poor to work towards gaining a place of
value in society. They are your brothers and sisters, and many are simply asking for a path to citizenship and
conveyance of rights like our forefathers were given in the early part of the 20 th century.
