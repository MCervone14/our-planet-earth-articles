Louisville with 8,000 trees. Trees, shrubs and other plants will be placed where they can best
soak up lung-damaging pollution (James Bruggers, 10/26/17, Courier Journal). Trees give us
oxygen to breathe; shade; sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere; and filter pollutants."

Have you heard about the Louisville, Kentucky, “Green Heart” project －“Do trees make you
healthier?” This 6-year study (the first of its kind) will transform four neighborhoods in South
Louisville with 8,000 trees. Trees, shrubs and other plants will be placed where they can best
soak up lung-damaging pollution (James Bruggers, 10/26/17, Courier Journal). Trees give us
oxygen to breathe; shade; sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere; and filter pollutants.

Louisville lost some 54,000 trees annually between 2004 and 2012 to development, storms, pests
and old age; and the tree canopy has dropped to 37 percent, well below other cities in the region.
Since 1996, The American Lung Association has given Louisville a failing grade (Judy
Woodruff, 12/12/19, PBS News Hour). The city is also one of the nation’s fastest-warming urban
heat islands, with parts of the city 10º F hotter than surrounding areas. For a variety of reasons,
there’s also a dramatic longevity difference with trees between east Louisville (13 years higher)
and the west side, with fewer trees. “These conditions were before the emerald ash borer began
wiping out tens of thousands of trees locally and 100 million trees in the Midwest” (James
Bruggers, 10/26/17, Courier Journal).

Aruni Bhatnagar, Ph.D., a medical professor at the University of Louisville, said, “This work
will tell us exactly how to design a neighborhood that supports human health, one that might
provide protection from everything from asthma to heart disease to dementia.” In this study, his
team will compare health for 700 participants from four neighborhoods with and without tree
plantings. One earlier project included trees and shrubbery planted in the front lawn of St.
Margaret Mary Catholic School to act as filters for air pollution from Shelbyville Road. “Levels
of the smallest particulates dropped 60 percent, and there were indications that some students’
immune systems improved,” said, Bhatnagar.

The Nature Conservancy (Green Heart Louisville Project, 8/21/18) gives benefits of urban trees
as:

- filtering up to a third of fine particle pollutants within 300 yards of a tree
- cooling city streets by 2-4⁰ F, and reducing deaths from heat and cutting energy use
- reducing rates of cardiac disease, strokes, and asthma due to improved air quality
- protecting biodiversity, including habitat for migrating birds and pollinators
- reducing obesity levels by increasing physical activity like walking and cycling
- managing stormwater, keeping pollutants out of waterways, and reducing urban flooding
- increasing neighborhood property values
- reducing stress by helping interrupt thought patterns that lead to anxiety and depression

In an independent study, Linda George, Ph.D., found a relationship between the reduction of
nitrogen dioxide and where there was vegetation. “So wherever there seemed to be trees, there
seemed to be less NO2 (Elizabeth Hendrickson, 10/6/14, Vanguard, “Study looks at relationship
between trees and NO2” ).

Even though trees are important, some people are allergic to tree pollen. “Thankfully, only about
100 of more than 50,000 tree species cause allergies” (Pollen Library: Plants that cause allergies
\- Healthline, Michael Kerr, 11/13/18). Therefore, care should be taken in the types of trees we
plant and their locations.

## What can we do?

Attend the Diocese of Evansville’s first Season of Creation Green Mass at 11 a.m. CDT Oct. at
Sts. Mary and John Church in Evansville. Diocesan Vicar General Very Rev. Alex Zenthoefer
will preside.
