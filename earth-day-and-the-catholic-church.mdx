_Editor’s note: This series takes a deeper look at Pope Francis’ 2015 encyclical － “On Care for Our Common
Home, Laudato Si’”_

Gaylord Nelson, who founded Earth Day, saw, in the 1960’s, a deteriorating environment and Anti-Vietnam
War protests. Both gave him the idea for a “teach-in” about environmental issues on April 22, 1970, the first
Earth Day. It’s estimated that 20 million people participated in this event, according to “The History of Earth
Day, Adirondack Council.” The first two websites under “What can we do!” give ideas for Earth Day on April
22, 2023.

In addition, we find, in the Vatican’s archives and libraries from 1948 to today, how the Church has embraced
care for creation long before the ecological crisis became part of the global discourse (Theodore Lai and Cecilia
Tortajada, “The Holy See and the Global Environmental Movement,” 7/22/2021). The last seven popes have
voiced their concerns.

In 2015, Pope Francis called for a change in the world’s energy system, saying, “There is an urgent need to
develop policies so that, in the next few years, the emission of carbon dioxide and other highly polluting gases
can be drastically reduced, e.g., substituting for fossil fuels and developing sources of renewable energy”
(Laudato Si’, 26).

In 2010, Pope Benedict XVI asked people to take action to safeguard the climate, saying, “degradation of the
environment is a pressing moral problem that threatens peace and human life itself. We cannot remain
indifferent to what is happening around us, for the deterioration of any one part of the planet affects us all”
(Pope’s peace message focuses on environment, 1/1/2010).
In 1989, Pope John Paul II said, “In our day, there is a growing awareness that world peace is threatened not
only by the arms race, regional conflicts and continued injustices among peoples and nations, but also by a lack
of due respect for nature ….” (No. 1, Pope John Paul II, The Ecological Crisis: A Common Responsibility,
12/8/1989).

In 1971, then-Archbishop Albino Luciani (later Pope John Paul I) suggested dioceses in rich countries tithe 1%
of their income to Vatican charities working in the developing world. This should be given, he said, “not as
alms, but as something that is owed ....” (“Pope John Paul I, an alternative to the ‘celebrity saint’,” Our Faith, J.
Peter Nixon, 8/31/2022).

In 1971, Pope Paul VI, in “Octogesima adveniens,” warned, “we risk destroying nature and then becoming a
victim of its degradation. He refers to pollution, refuse and the absolute destructive capacity of the human race
.…” (Philip Booth, Online Course Unit 8, The environment, Catholic social teaching and public policy, St.
Mary’s University, Twickenham, London).

In 1963, Pope John XXIII supported the use of renewable energy – including solar, wind and geothermal – well
before the rest of the world. (Theodore Lai and Cecilia Tortajada, “The Holy See and the Global Environmental
Movement,” 7/22/2021).

In 1948, Pope Pius XII spoke to delegates from the European nations, and the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations, which led to the formation of the Indo-Pacific Fisheries Council
(Thompson, R. J., 1943, The United Nations Conference on Food and Agriculture. J. R. Stat. Soc. 106,
273–276).
