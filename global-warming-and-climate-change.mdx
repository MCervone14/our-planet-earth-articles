## Introduction

In previous articles, we’ve highlighted Pope Francis’ efforts in “Laudato Si’” and discussed
many ecological principles. But there’s more, such as melting of the Earth’s permafrost; melting
of glaciers and icebergs; and a reduction in albedo (reflectivity of the sun’s rays) by snow
covered areas in the world.

“Fossil fuel emissions from human activities are driving up the Earth’s temperature, and nature is
responding by raising temperatures even higher” reports Climate Emergency-Feedback Loops
(Moving Still Productions, Inc., 2021). They say, “We need to reduce fossil fuel emissions, re-
green the Earth, and stop deforestation” so that we can offset global warming and climate
change. Sanctuaries in Southern Indiana: A Faith-based View of Sycamore’s Work by Rabbi
Brian Besser (The Twig, Winter-Spring 2021, pages 14-16) is another reference that gives even
more reasons for preservation, conservation and restoration measures.

The melting of permafrost is a significant issue. Permafrost takes up about one quarter of the
northern hemisphere, and has much carbon in its soil. It’s normally frozen, and melts and
refreezes for short periods of time. But with global warming, it melts earlier and freezes later
allowing microbes in the soil to digest the carbon that produces carbon dioxide and methane.
These greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere at alarming rates today.

The reduction of albedo is another important issue. The poles can reflect significant amounts of
the sun’s rays and act as natural mirrors. But with melting of the poles, glaciers and icebergs, we
have more water that absorbs heat; and more greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere that
contribute to sea-level rise. In some ocean basins, sea levels have risen 6-8 inches since the start
of the satellite record in 1993 (Rebecca Lindsey, NOAA Climate.gov, January 25, 2021). With
sea levels rising, what will happen to people living along the coast?

Our atmosphere has too many greenhouse gases, and we need to reduce them by not burning
fossil fuels. With these gases is water vapor. Clouds may cool the Earth’s surface by reflection,
or they may heat the Earth’s surface by trapping heat. When we emit fossil fuel gases, the
atmospheric temperature rises, oceans warm, water vapor increases from evaporation, all of
which trap more heat in the atmosphere. This scenario drives hurricanes, which have been
predicted to increase in number and severity.

Also, “greenhouse gases are increasingly disrupting the jet stream, a powerful river of winds that
steers weather systems in the Northern Hemisphere that cause more frequent summer droughts,
floods and wildfires” (Inside Climate News, Bob Berwyn, 10/31/2018). Regions normally wet
will have more flooding, and regions usually dry will show more droughts. Melting of Greenland
and polar caps is affecting the Gulf Stream too (Tim Radford, Concern as Climate Impacts on
Gulf Stream Flow, Our World – Brought to you by United Nations University, 4/2/2015).

In summary, we need to reduce fossil-fuel emissions, re-green the Earth, stop deforestation and
stop all losses to green ecosystems throughout the world. We need to return Earth back to nearly
how our Lord created it, and in this way we will be “good and faithful servants.” As the United
Nations Secretary-General (Antonio Guterrres) said on 8/9/2021, “There is no time for delay,
and no room for excuses.”
