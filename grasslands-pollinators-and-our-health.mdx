## Introduction

Grasslands go by different names. In the U.S. Midwest, they’re called prairies; in South
America, pampas; in Central Eurasia, steppes; and in Africa, savannas. What they all have in
common are perennial, bunch grasses (little bluestem, big bluestem, Indiangrass) and
wildflowers (milkweed, coneflowers, sunflowers).

Prescribed fires conducted by authorized and trained personnel are essential to maintaining
prairies and killing tree saplings before they produce seeds. Fires also clear out ground litter so
sunlight can reach prairie plants, with roots of some prairie plants extending 10 feet or more into
the soil keeping plants protected from fires. One excellent example of a prairie is Kankakee
Sands (Visit - Efroymson Restoration at Kankakee Sands, 2021, The Nature Conservancy)
including its grazing American bison.

About one quarter of Earth’s land is covered with grasslands. Many of these grasslands have
been converted to farmland because their rich black soils (with soil carbon) and other nutrients
are great for growing crops. For this reason, the Indiana State Wildlife Action Plan identified
grassland habitat loss as the largest habitat decline in the state.

Grasslands are important because they absorb water; recharge groundwater; reduce flooding and
run-off into streams; keep watersheds free of pollutants; and serve as habitat for many animals.
Many of our most vulnerable species live in grasslands. Examples are bobwhite quail, Henslow’s
sparrow, loggerhead shrike and ring-necked pheasant. Some species no longer exist in Indiana,
like the greater prairie chicken. Its last sighting in Indiana was 1972 (Greater Prairie Chicken,
Tippecanoe Audubon, posted June 21, 2012).

There is hope with Indiana DNR’s plan to establish more acres of new grasslands, which will
benefit threatened and endangered species and pollinators. Pollinators are any animals (bees,
wasps, moths, butterflies, beetles, birds and mammals) that help carry pollen to the female part
of the same or another flower.

Did you know grasslands are globally important, because they are natural carbon sinks? These
ecosystems capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and act like forests, oceans and
wetlands, capturing and storing this heat-absorbing molecule. “A study from the University of
California, Davis, found grasslands are more resilient carbon sinks than forests” (Kat Kerline ,
July 9, 2018). Also ― did you know about 15% of Indiana was once grassland with less than
1,000 acres left today (Our Land, Our Literature: Environment – Tall Grass Prairies)?

Indiana DNR is making a difference though in more grasslands with its 2015 Grasslands for
Gamebirds and Songbirds (GGS) Initiative. Its goals are to:

- develop and improve grasslands and pollinator habitats
- improve soil health and water quality
- promote species diversity
- grow outdoor recreation opportunities
- enrich human health
- increase funding to local economies
- preserve cultural heritage

By preserving and developing more grasslands, we improve air and water quality, and protect
soils, plants and animals. Through many years of conversion into farmland, grasslands have
decreased in size and number causing a loss of vulnerable species like the Monarch butterfly,
rusty patched bumblebee, grasshopper sparrow and many others. Fortunately, the Indiana DNR
manages and restores grasslands for birds and other species on public land and private land.

- Support grasslands. It is said by Brianne Lowe, State Biologist (NRCS) that generally “one
  out of every three bites of food we take is thanks to a pollinator.” Planting grasslands
  increases pollinators!
