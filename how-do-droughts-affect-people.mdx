## Introduction

Did you know future droughts in the world may even surpass the [Sahel disaster](https://www2.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/adai/news/Dai_Drought_MSNBC.htm)? Droughts in the African
countries of the Sahel caused massive losses of agricultural production and livestock, loss of human lives to
hunger, malnutrition and disease, huge displacements of people, and shattered economies. According to the
[USA for United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees](https://www.unrefugees.org/emergencies/sahel-crisis), more than 4.2 million people have been displaced
across the region; 3.7 million people have been internally displaced; and more than 10 million children are in
need of humanitarian assistance. [Climate change](https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2013/sahel-one-region-many-crises) could bring about even more consequences.

Droughts are not only in other countries, but [crops in the Midwest](https://kansasreflector.com/2023/06/28/drought-hits-the-midwest-threatening-crops-and-the-worlds-food-supply/) have been affected as well as the world’s
food supply, and some have even found a
[strong correlation between times of drought and the major collapse of the Maya civilization](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-11/7%20Drought%20and%20the%20Ancient%20Maya%20Civilization%20-%20FINAL%20OCT%202021.pdf). Other factors that contributed to the Mayan collapse may be overpopulation,
deforestation, soil erosion, and disease. The [Current Indiana Drought Map](https://www.drought.gov/states/indiana#historical-conditions) shows 14.4% abnormally dry and
62.5% moderate drought.

On May 1, 2023 on I-55 in Illinois, 8 people died and over 30 people injured by a dust storm causing a pile-up
of 72-vehicles. The Illinois State Police said, “excessive winds blowing dirt from farm fields across the highway
led to zero visibility.” [News reports noted dust storms](https://blog.ucsusa.org/karen-perry-stillerman/illinois-dust-storm-disaster-is-a-warning-for-agriculture/) are rare in Illinois, but drier, hotter conditions in many
farming communities could make such events more frequent and deadly.

In the 1930’s, we had the drought-stricken Dust Bowl. [It killed around 7,000 people and left 2 million homeless](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dust-bowl-heat-wave-climate-change-twice-as-likely-study-says/).
The heat, drought and dust storms had a cascade effect too on the U.S. agriculture. Wheat production fell by
36% and maize production plummeted by 48%.

## What Can You Do?

**Reduce loss of soil** - “ [Soil is a living thing](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2022-12/Montana-Soil-Is-Alive.pdf). It is very slowly moving, changing and growing all the time. Just
like other living things, soil breathes and needs air and water to stay alive. Healthy, living soil provides all of us
with our everyday needs.” Many animals, fungi, bacteria, and plants live in the soil and help control erosion and
decomposition. No-till farming reduces erosion and helps maintain important groundwater levels.

**Plant cover crops** - Agricultural fields must have cover crops throughout the year with roots in the ground.
“ [Planting cover crops provides multiple benefits](https://www.usda.gov/peoples-garden/soil-health/cover-crops-crop-rotation#:) such as controlling erosion, suppressing weeds, reducing soil compaction, increasing moisture and nutrient content of soil, improving yield potential, attracting pollinators, and providing habitat for beneficial insects and wildlife, and food to animals.” Elsewhere, we should preserve, restore, and create more wetlands, forests, and grasslands.

**Plant filter strips along waterways** - Filter strips along ditches and streams in proximity to farmlands help
greatly in controlling erosion and keeping chemicals and sediments from entering waterways.
A [two-stage ditch helps keep water clear and limits the input of farm chemicals](https://www.indianawatershedinitiative.com/uploads/8/0/9/5/80953414/davis_et_al_2015.pdf). Such ditches have benches that are [planted with grasses that significantly absorb or reduce phosphorus concentrations and reduce turbidity](https://www.indianawatershedinitiative.com/uploads/8/0/9/5/80953414/mahl_et_al_2015.pdf). Nitrogen removal was also increased especially when benches were flooded. These two-stage ditches act similar to
a constructed wetland for wastewater treatment.
