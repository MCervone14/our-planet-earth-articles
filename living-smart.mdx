## <u>Introduction</u>

Did you know [July 2023 was hotter than any other month on record](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-clocks-july-2023-as-hottest-month-on-record-ever-since-1880) as felt by billions around the world?
Throughout the country, Americans are now experiencing firsthand, the effects of climate change. To address
this issue, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law by President Joe Biden on August 16, 2022. The
National Aeronautics and Space Administrator Bill Nelson says, “The science is clear. We must act now to
protect our communities and planet; it’s the only one we have.”

Scientists have warned us for decades about global warming and climate change. “A recent report from the
United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [underscored the need for international action](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/) to
avoid increasingly severe climate impacts in the years to come. Steps outlined in the report, and by climate
experts, include major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from sectors such as energy production and
transportation.” How Americans feel about climate change, and what steps they think the United States should
take may be found at the [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/09/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-climate-change/). With a  [majority of people](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2022/08/31/climate-change-remains-top-global-threat-across-19-country-survey/)  aware of the calamitous threats posed
by climate change, Cardinal Michael Czerny at Gonzaga University said, “the real problem now is not
convincing people that it&#39;s happening, but rather indifference and despair in the face of that reality.”

Knowing our actions affect ourselves, families, and many generations to come, it’s our duty to prevent getting
to a “tipping” point of no return as said by the [Dalai Lama](https://xrpdx.org/tipping-points-and-greta-and-the-dalai-lama-oh-my/). At this time, our only living smart option is to live in
a way that maximizes our returns.

## <u>What Can You Do?</u>

**Reduce Greenhouse Gases escaping into the Atmosphere** - Methods include: transforming our energy needs
from non-renewable to renewable; slowly reduce the number of miles we travel in cars, trucks, planes, or trains;
rethink use of electric and hybrid vehicles; vacation near home; use less electricity; go carbon neutral; wake up
earlier, and go to bed earlier; take opportunities to see local friends and neighbors, and by phone or computer,
call distant friends and family; and turn our properties into park like and green havens.

**Water Use** - As we grow in population, our water consumption will increase and groundwater availability will
decrease. Thus, it is most important that we reduce impervious surfaces and increase soft green surfaces for
water absorption, percolation, and raise groundwater levels and their quality. We need also to increase no-till
farming and use of cover crops year round, since we can not afford to waste water through run-off that increases
soil erosion, and chemical contamination in streams, rivers and oceans.
[Be concerned about soil health, and capturing rainwater for other uses](https://www.epa.gov/soakuptherain/what-you-can-do-soak-rain).

**Live a Simpler Life with Fewer Needs** - We have Our Planet Earth to nurture us. Treat the Earth respectfully,
and be active outside during the day when it is cooler. At your home, maybe use a basement in summer and
upstairs in winter. In addition, insulate walls and attic; use curtains and blinds, and [shade your property](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-prevention/sun-protection/preventing-skin-cancer/shade/) well
with trees to keep cool in summer, and warm in winter. Also, consider using energy-efficient windows and take
advantage of the aspect of your home, where generally the south-facing side is hotter than north-facing, and
west-facing is warmer than east-facing. Living smart is very important.
