Did you know the that U.S. Department of the Interior protects coastlines for the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans, Gulf of Mexico, and our five Great Lakes? Lake Michigan touches 45 miles of
Indiana coastline, including Indiana Dunes National Park. It was authorized by Congress in 1966
as the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, and re-designated as the nation&#39;s 61st National Park
Feb 15, 2019. Oceans, coastlines and the Great Lakes need protection because they are God’s
gifts for our enjoyment and survival, and they affect people throughout the world.

Oceans make up 71% of the Earth. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says
that our oceans provide vast benefits, including:

- Oxygen - over half of world’s production
- CO 2 storage – stores 50X more than the atmosphere
- Climate regulation – transports heat from the equator to poles regulating climate and weather patterns
- Transportation – involves 76% of all U.S. trade
- Food – great variety
- Recreation – provides fishing, boating and tourism
- Economy – $282 billion in U.S. goods and service with businesses employing almost 3 million people
- Medicines – provide many medicinal products including ingredients that fight cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer’s disease and heart disease.

In addition, coastlines are important because they bring fresh and saltwater together in close
proximity to dry land, creating a diverse range of nutrients for marine and land life. Many animals
and plants live along coastlines, with one especially important ecosystem being coral reefs. MIT
Science Policy Review (Rivera, Chan, and Luu, 8/20/20) reports, “Coral reefs provide
ecosystem services worth $11 trillion annually by protecting coasts, sustaining fisheries,
generating tourism and creating jobs across the tropics. However, ocean warming is
widespread and a threat to coral reefs globally. International climate agreements that aim to
continually reduce carbon emissions are our best hopes for the survival of reefs.”

The 2017 Netflix film “Chasing Corals” reported that 50% of coral reefs in the world, and
80-90% of coral reefs in Florida, have been lost. It shows coral reefs dying from high
ocean water temperatures, similar to what happens when humans have a life-threatening
fever. “ A Plastic Ocean” (Netflix, 2016) is another powerful movie on how the ocean and
coastlines are being adversely affected by plastic. Please visit: Five Simple Changes to
Move You Closer to a Plastic-Free Home (Earth 911, M. Somerville, 3/8/19) for reducing
plastic use.

The Great Lakes also are very important natural resources. “They are the world’s largest surface
freshwater ecosystem and contain 20 percent of all surface freshwater on the planet. More than
35 million people in eight states and Canada depend on the Great Lakes for drinking water. The
Great Lakes watershed provides habitat for wildlife – with millions of migratory birds passing
through in the spring and fall ― and they are home to many fish. In spite of their majesty, the
Great Lakes are fragile and face serious threats from invasive species, toxins, water diversion,
wetland destruction, sewage overflows and climate change.” (National Wildlife Federation).
National Geographic published “North America’s Most Valuable Resource Is at Risk” (Tim
Folger, 11/17/20), in which he emphasized the importance of diatoms (single-celled algae having
a cell wall of silica) in the Great Lakes that produce atmospheric oxygen.

Healthy oceans, coastlines and freshwater lakes make for a healthy planet. Let’s protect all
people, animals and plants in perpetuity!
