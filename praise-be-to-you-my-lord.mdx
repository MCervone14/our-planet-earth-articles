Home, Laudato Si’_

## Introduction

Do you know how important you are? For every stewardship decision you make, you change and impact the
world! As good and faithful stewards, and as a Christian community, we are required to praise, seek and follow
God in everything we do because He is guiding us to do the best for our planet Earth. It should not be a one-
day-a-year event on Earth Day. It should be a daily requirement of our faith according to the United States
Conference of Catholic Bishops, which says that, in that requirement, “We show our respect for the Creator by
our stewardship in protecting people and the planet, and to live our relationship with all of God’s creation.”

Our paths in life require us to recognize a universal “sense of responsible stewardship (Laudato Si’, 116) …
directing us to be stewards of all creation (Laudato Si’, 236).” In detail, our stewardship follows what St. Teresa
of Avila teaches us: “Christ has no body now but yours.” Archbishop Patrick O’Regan says that most of us
don’t realize that, “all we have and all that we are is a gift from God. When we realize this, then our role
changes from (ownership) to care and look after.” We truly are the caregivers of all creation and Earth; and
everything you do, Jesus does through you.

In Indiana alone, natural disasters have more than tripled and costs have doubled. This significant increase in
“billion-dollar disasters” is linked to global warming from the emission of greenhouse gases. The Evansville
Climate Action Plan 2021 in Vanderburgh County (Source: Purdue University Indiana Climate Change Impacts
Assessment, page 28) reports:

- In 1981-2000, we had 17 events totaling $5-10 billion.
- While in 2001-2020, we had 55 events totaling $10-20 billion (NOAA Temperature Time Series)

Pope Francis calls all religions and the secular world to partner on care for our common home, with Cardinal
Robert McElroy emphasizing how fragile the Earth is in many places of the world. TheLetterFilm/watch,
released in the U.S. on 6/9/20, reported how indigenous communities still maintain 80 percent of the world’s
biodiversity, and that, by 2050, experts predict there could be as many as 1.2 billion people displaced by climate
change. As of November 2022, the world population is reported at 7.98 billion (World Population Clock).

As responsible caregivers of all creation and Earth, we should leave this world more beautiful and bountiful
than it was when we inherited it. Let’s bring goodness and kindness, and preserve our Mother Earth. Praise be
to you, my Lord, for all of the blessings you have bestowed upon us, and help us continue our Care for Our
Mother Earth.
