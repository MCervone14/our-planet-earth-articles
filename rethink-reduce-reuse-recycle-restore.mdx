**Our Planet Earth**

_Editor’s note: This series takes a deeper look at Pope Francis’ 2015 encyclical － “On Care for Our Common
Home, Laudato Si’”_

There are simple and economic ways to live an environmentally sensitive and thoughtful lifestyle. For instance,
we could rethink, reduce, reuse, recycle and restore. Applying these five R’s will reduce our carbon footprint,
promote healthy environments, increase soil fertility, and improve Earth’s air, water, and land.

The Evansville Climate Action Plan (2021) of Vanderburgh County, Indiana (pg. 28) says, “weather records
show that Indiana has become warmer and wetter, with more heavy downpours. Indiana scientists have
concluded these climate trends will continue and intensify, affecting the health and well-being of all Hoosiers”
(Purdue University Indiana Climate Change Impacts Assessment). As a result, implementing the five R’s is so
important.

Rethink could mean to buy local. Michael Shuman (Going Local, 2000) says, “Going local does not mean
walling off the outside world. It means nurturing locally own businesses that use local resources sustainably,
employ local workers, and serve local consumers to become more self-sufficient and less dependent on
imports.” Also, we may rethink the mail, food we eat, bags we use, energy use, consuming less, closer vacations
and living simpler lives.

Reduce means using less. Many things we have can be donated, and having fewer things can simplify our lives.
Kimberly Nicholas (Under the Sky We Make, 2021) says, “Both individual and collective actions, in private
and professional life, are needed to reduce emissions toward zero fast (pg.143-144); we will not solve climate
change without reducing over consumption from high emitters (pg.145); and if you start by reducing flights,
driving and meat, you’ll be having the biggest bang for your climate buck (pg.146).” Buying less is great too.

Reuse is to use something again. For example, using a permanent straw in a permanent water container that can
be cleaned. Another example of reusing comes from Chuck Masek, founder of Vanguard Medical Concepts,
Inc., where he innovated and developed the reprocessing of medical devices labeled single-use industry. Also,
composting converts wastes into mulch or soil, and having products repaired helps the economy and earth.

Recycle is when we sort items at home and business for collection in urban and rural areas, and use these
materials again. Some examples are rain barrels to collect rainwater for watering gardens during times of
drought; cities having a &quot;Tox Away Day” for safe disposal of household hazardous chemicals; and cities having
a recyclable day for electronics. Remember – recyclables should be empty, clean, and dry.

Restore means to make green. For example, let’s restore prairies, forests, wetlands and stream banks; and design
complete streets, rain gardens, green roofs and green bridges. Properties should be permeable and park-like with
less lawn. In addition, consider growing flowers and vegetables together (foodscaping); and growing trees on
managed farms that provide shade and food to livestock and shade to crops (silvopasture). Also, appreciate the
great benefits of Evansville’s many parks, the Pigeon Creek Greenway Passage and Kentucky’s Green River
National Wildlife Refuge along the Ohio River. They all reduce flooding, capture greenhouse gases, cool the air
and offer recreational opportunities.
