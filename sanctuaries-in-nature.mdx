A nature sanctuary is a protected area for animals, plants and natural communities. In Indiana,
we have three National Wildlife Refuges – Muscatatuck, Patoka River and Big Oaks. In
Kentucky, there are two in our region – Green River and Clarks River. Also, we have many other
parks, preserves, and natural areas.

Muscatatuck (established in 1966) provides resting and feeding areas for waterfowl during their
annual migrations. More than 280 species of birds have been seen there. It is recognized as a
“Continentally Important” bird area, and includes 7,724 acres near Seymour, Indiana, and 78
acres ( Restle Unit ) near Bloomington, Indiana.

Patoka River (established in 1994) is one of the most significant bottomland hardwood forest
habitats remaining in the Midwest. With an acquisition goal of 22,472-acres, it now consists of
10,642-acres. The Cane Ridge Wildlife Management Area is a satellite unit west of Princeton,
Indiana. Both areas are designated as &quot;Important Bird Areas” where over 1,000 acres have been
restored with 500,000-plus hardwood trees. Its office is in Oakland City, Indiana.

Big Oaks (established in 2000) is known for 500-plus pairs of Henslow&#39;s sparrows estimated to
breed in its grasslands. This refuge has been designated as a “Globally Important Bird Area”
because of its value to Henslow&#39;s sparrows and other migratory birds. It includes 50,000 acres.
Its office is located on the cantonment area of the former Jefferson Proving Grounds off the
south end of the refuge.

In addition, Indiana has more than 290 state preserves. One is Wesselman Woods Nature
Preserve, including Howell Wetlands, in Evansville. Wesselman Woods features 200 acres of
old-growth lowland hardwood forest and is home to more than 300 species of wildflowers, 150
species of birds, and many reptiles, amphibians, and fish.

Howell Wetlands features 35 acres of marshland, bald cypress slough, oxbow lake, lowland
hardwood forest, and prairie. Beavers, green tree frogs, wood ducks, geese and deer can be seen
there. Both Wesselman Woods and Howell Wetlands are tranquil nature sanctuaries and offer
great opportunities to relax in nature.

North of Evansville is the Blue Grass Fish and Wildlife Area, Pike State Forest, and Sugar Ridge
Fish and Wildlife Area; west of Evansville is Twin Swamps Nature Preserve, and Hovey Lake
Fish and Wildlife Area. South of Evansville is Burdette Park and Eagle Slough Natural Area.

Immediately south of Evansville in Kentucky is the Green River NWR (established in 2019),
which now has about 440 acres of a proposed 53,000-acre Conservation Partnership Area. This
region is best known for wetland forests associated with the confluence of the Ohio and Green
Rivers. Once established, it will provide many benefits, e.g., hunting, fishing, removing CO 2
from the atmosphere to offset climate change, and much more. It is currently supervised by the
Manager of Clarks River NWR in Benton, Kentucky. Also in Kentucky and near Evansville is
the John James Audubon State Park and Nature Preserve, Green River State Forest, and Sloughs
Wildlife Management Area.
