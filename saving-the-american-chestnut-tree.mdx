**Introduction**

In 1904, a fungal disease, _Cryphonectria parasitica_, was introduced from Japanese [chestnut trees brought into
the Bronx Zoo](https://www.npr.org/local/305/2021/10/18/1047023029/the-american-chestnut-was-wiped-out-a-century-ago-could-it-make-a-comeback). By the year 1906, [98% of the chestnut trees in the Bronx](https://patriciatemplesphotography.com/2020/02/06/trees-and-their-stories-2/) were infected. In 40 years, 4 billion
American chestnuts perished.

The American chestnut tree was once called the “redwood of the eastern forest.” It was fast-growing and had
majestic heights, trunks, and an extensive mast crop. It’s heritage is remembered fondly, e.g., do you remember
Nat King Cole (1961) singing “chestnuts roasting on an open fire….” But today, the chestnut tree is [listed as
endangered in the United States and Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_chestnut). Nonetheless, we’re fortunate this fungus did not affect the roots
where today, small shoots grow from former live trees until they get infected too. [Outside it’s natural range](https://myqualityday.blogspot.com/2017/07/american-chestnut-in-michigan.html),
many mature American Chestnut trees have been reported.

It’s wood is rot-resistant, straight-grained, and used for building and furniture. The nuts were food for many
wildlife and humans. Chestnut wood was also used for log cabin foundations, fence posts, flooring, caskets,
[railroad ties, and both telephone and telegraph poles, many of which are still in use today](https://tacf.org/the-american-chestnut/history-american-chestnut/). Some trees lived 600
years and had 17-foot diameters (largest). Please visit the podcast of Joe Lamp’l on [Restoring the American
Chestnut: An All-Out Effort to Save this Iconic Species](https://joegardener.com/podcast/restoring-the-american-chestnut/).

**What Can You Do?**

[The American Chestnut Foundation](https://tacf.org/) (TACF) is leading the rescue mission. [Since 1983, they’ve tried many
methods](https://tacf.org/science-strategies/3bur/) to create “a disease tolerant and genetically diverse population of American chestnut trees that will be
adaptable to broad and changing climates.” Please watch their trailer below and become a member.

Methods for rescuing the American Chestnut include:

- Breeding - Crossing blight resistant Chinese chestnuts with American chestnuts producing improved blight
  resistant American chestnuts. After 4 generations, TACF’s program has produced a genetically diverse
  population of American chestnut hybrids as carried out at their farm in Meadowview, Virginia, and at many
  other orchards across TACF chapters throughout it’s range.

- Biotechnology - Inserting a gene from a wheat plant which produces an enzyme called oxalate oxidase,
  which enhances blight tolerance. The State University of New York College of Environmental Science and
  Forestry (SUNY-ESF) discovered chestnut trees that contain this resistance gene can be infected by the
  chestnut blight, but do not die. This resistance gene is passed down to the tree&#39;s offspring to provide
  subsequent generations with partial blight resistance. Extensive testing done on this Darling 58 transgenic
  variant showed [survival, pollen use, and reproduction of bumble bees](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34110572/) were not affected by oxalate oxidase
  at typical concentrations used. On August 19, 2020, SUNY-ESF submitted a petition to the United States
  Department of Agriculture for Determination of Non-regulated Status for Blight-Resistant Darling 58
  American chestnut in the Federal Register of government documents. Darling 58 could be the first
  genetically modified forest trees released in the wild in the United States.

- Biocontrol - Something called hypovirulence where a virus is inserted that reduces the ability of the
  chestnut blight fungus to cause lethal infections.

Lastly, American chestnuts can be infected by _Phytophthora cinnamomi_ that causes root rot or ink disease.
TACF and others are making efforts to breed American chestnut trees that are resistant to this disease.
