**Our Planet Earth**

**Editor’s note:**
_This series takes a deeper look at Pope Francis’ 2015 encyclical ― On Care for Our Common
Home, Laudato Si’ and his 2021 Platform Goals._

Why should we care about this anniversary? Maybe because anniversaries become useful when we
use them to ask questions like, “Have we listened to Pope Francis, and is the temperature of the Earth
really increasing?” Compared with a decade ago, more Americans say protecting the environment
and dealing with global climate change should be top priorities (PEW Research Center, Funk and
Kennedy, How Americans see climate change and the environment in seven charts, 4/21/20).

Today, we find more dioceses developing Action Platform Plans; cities Climate Action Plans and
Green Heart Projects (Louisville, Kentucky); and greater education on environmental issues,
notably by our Catholic religious sisters. Also, there are more creation-care groups. One global
example is the Laudato Si’ Movement, and two local examples are Tri-State Creation Care and
Congregations Acting for Justice and Empowerment. Please see the “What can we do?” section
below for more.

The Laudato Si’ Movement, formerly Global Catholic Climate Movement, was founded in 2015.
Today, it is active on six continents and helps in spirituality, lifestyles and sustainability. Its
executive director reminds us this year about:

- Laudato Si’ Week (May 22-29);
- Season of Creation from September 1 to October 4;
- the Laudato Si’ movie;
- recommends a larger turnout and better results at COP27.

Tri-State Creation Care formed in 2015 to plan for its first speaker, Maryknoll Sister Janet
Miller. This group provides information on protecting land, water and air, and promotes
renewable energy. It annually holds a conference, plus about nine presentations. Its 2022
conference focused on sustainable agriculture for a livable, healthy planet. On Oct. 1, it will have
poet laureate Matthew Graham read nature-based poems at Seton Harvest Farm. Also, it plans to
initiate &quot;EVs for EVV,&quot; an Evansville ride-and-drive event for electric vehicles.

CAJE was founded in 2003. Listening sessions are held in the member congregations annually in
September; and in November, topics are chosen in the Community Problems Assembly. Topics
include, but are not limited to, affordable housing initiatives; safe neighborhoods; a jail-diversion
program; justice in care for mental-health patients, including those with autism; and advocating
for the provision of NARCAN for administration by first responders.  Every spring, CAJE holds
its Nehemiah Action, inviting those in power to come before member congregations to address
the specific problems of the community.

Earlier this year, Bishop Joseph M. Siegel celebrated the Diocese of Evansville’s annual
Rogation Mass, which celebrates the importance of farming. Also, Deacon Jim Rush from the
Diocese of Lafayette-in-Indiana wrote an article published in the April 3 issue of the Lafayette
diocesan newspaper, The Catholic Moment, headlined, “Catholic community strives to honor
creation, becoming advocates for the environment.” Deacon Jim writes about the seventh
commandment, Thou shall not steal, which is what we’re doing to our global neighbors and
future generations. Earth Day was April 22; its theme was “Invest in our planet.” Arbor Day was
April 29.

We want everyone to feel good that we’ve achieved two huge milestones:

- “The world has finally stopped using leaded gasoline…..” (Camila Domonaske, NPR,8/30/21), and
- “We saved the ozone layer. We can save the climate” (David Doniger, NRDC, 4/17/19).

Excellent precursors to “Laudato Si’” include:

- “The Ecological Crisis: A Common Responsibility,” by St. Pope John Paul II (12/8/89);
- “Renewing the Earth,” by Catholic Bishops, USA (1992); and
- “Care for the Earth,” by the Indiana Catholic Conference (May 2000).
