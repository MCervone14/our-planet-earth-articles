Did you know Indiana has a list of 157 endangered and special-concern wildlife species (Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, Division of Fish and Wildlife, November 2020)? To address
these species, a State Wildlife Action Plan was created that “provides an overview of
conservation threats in Indiana and identifies needed actions.” Did you know loss of habitat is
the No. 1 cause for loss of species? For example, in the Amazon, the world’s largest reservoir of
biodiversity, two-thirds of the species have lost habitat to fire and deforestation (Georgina
Gustin, 9/1/2021, Inside Climate News).

One vulnerable group of wildlife in Indiana are bats that hibernate in caves. In 2012, the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service estimated 5.5 to 6.7 million bats in the United States died from a
fungal disease called White-Nose Syndrome. It kills 70-90% or more of bats in an affected cave
(Center for Biol. Diversity) and is caused by a cold-loving fungus called Pseudogymnoascus
destructans, first found in New York (2006) and later in Indiana (January 2011).

WNS predominantly affects hibernating bats (e.g. the Indiana bat, little brown bat, northern long-
eared bat and tri-colored bat) because they cluster in caves for warmth in winter and to groom
each other. One theory regarding why bats die from this fungal infection is they wake more often
during hibernation, thus depleting their fat reserves.

Bats are creatures of the night and are seldom seen, but serve a special purpose. They eat half
their body weight nightly in insects, includingsome that can destroy crops or carry diseases. With
losses from WNS, their ability to eat pest insects has declined. It is estimated that, with fewer
bats, farmers may need to spend $74 per acre more in pesticides (Boyles et al., Econ. Importance
of Bats in Agriculture. Science, 4/1/2011).

“Bats Under an Indiana Bridge” (Cervone et al., Proc. Indiana Acad. of Science, 125(2):91-102;
and in the worldwide bat database in Geneva, Switzerland) reported observing 8,570 bats from
2006-2011 under a bridge over a large river. Bats visited this bridge year after year, and Indiana
bats (federally endangered species) used it as a stopover during migration. The bridge also
provided protection from wind, rain, sunlight and predators; provided available food and water;
and was a constant in their life cycle. Indiana bats arrived as early as March 28 and departed as
late as Dec. 3. Under this bridge, little brown bats gave birth and nursed pups in June; young
were flying in July; mating was observed in August and September; and bats departed in October
and November. Studying these bats helped owners inspect other bridges for bats, and to make
repairs or demolish them when bats are not present.

WNS was introduced to the United States – like the gypsy moth, emerald ash borer, medfly, and
many other species. Our goal now is for people and nature to thrive together. Three suggested
ways to do this are: (1) shift to renewable energy sources, (2) restore biodiversity, and (3) end
deforestation (Key Takeaways from David Attenborough’s New Film, ‘A Life on our Planet’,
Earth.org, 10/8/2020).
