## Introduction

Did you know [spirituality involves the recognition](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/docs/default-source/members/sigs/spirituality-spsig/what-is-spirituality-maya-spencer-x.pdf) or feeling or belief that there is something greater than
yourself, something more to being human than a sensory experience? Dr. Maya Spencer from the Royal College
of Psychiatrists goes on to say, “Our lives have significance in a context beyond a mundane everyday existence
at the level of biological needs, and knowing that we are a significant part of a purposeful unfolding of life in
our universe.”

Spirituality gives us eyes to see and a heart to love nature which is not something to exploit nor take for granted.
Indigenous people have practiced for years living with and respecting nature. Despite representing less than
5% of the world’s population, indigenous peoples steward more than [a quarter of Earth’s land and seas, and
protect 80% of our global biodiversity](https://www.conservation.org/blog/3-ways-indigenous-knowledge-protects-nature). But for all their efforts in the Brazilian Amazon, they’ve been beaten
and killed by drug [trafficking cartels, and companies mining, land grabbing, and conducting illegal logging](https://news.mongabay.com/2022/08/crime-and-no-punishment-impunity-shrouds-killings-of-indigenous-amazonian-defenders/).

Since the early 1970s, the Amazon has lost much of its forest, and scientists are concerned that deforestation,
combined with forest degradation and the impacts of climate change, may put large areas of the rainforest at
risk, leading to [severe consequences for the region’s carbon storage, biodiversity, and rainfall patterns, plus the
well-being of local communities](https://news.mongabay.com/2023/09/deforestation-in-the-amazon-rainforest-continues-to-plunge/). Cardinal Joseph Tobin says though, [“Faith leaders can influence the world on
climate change”](https://www.ncronline.org/earthbeat/viewpoints/cardinal-tobin-faith-leaders-can-influence-world-climate-change) especially at the COP28 in Dubai.

To combat illegal deforestation, we are pleased to report the FOREST Act of 2023 was recently re-introduced
into the Senate with Senators Braun (IN-R) and Schatz (D-HI) serving as cosponsors. Its purpose is to prohibit
the importation of products made wholly or in part of certain commodities produced on land undergoing illegal
deforestation.

## What Can You Do?

**Pray for an Ecological Conversion** - An example is when St. Pope John Paul II hosted 60 different religions at
Assisi, Italy in 1986 to pray for peace. It brought together different religions under one purpose, to love each
other and learn to communicate rather than wage war. When people get to know each other, they become
friends not enemies. A beautiful photo at the summit was a Buddhist monk hugging the pope. Pray that all
countries in the world see one world where everything is connected. Pray for those who live in war zones.

**Be a Great Example of Stewardship** - There are many organizations trying to do the right thing related to the
environment. However, leadership is a critical component in what gets done or not. One way of making a big
change in the world is to purchase land and keep it in a natural state in perpetuity.

**Get Involved in a Community, State or Federal Government** - Our governments have elected officials. Let’s
tell them how we feel about issues. One way is to support the FOREST Act of 2023. You can do this by
acknowledging Senator Mike Braun and Senator Brian Schatz for cosponsoring it, and contacting the World
Wildlife Fund (lauren.gleason@wwfus.org) or Environmental Investigation Agency U.S. (dstilley@eia-global.org) for more information. Reach out to them respectfully!
