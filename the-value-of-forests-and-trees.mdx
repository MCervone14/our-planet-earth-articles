**Our Planet Earth**

**Editor’s note:** _This series takes a deeper look at Pope Francis’ 2015 encyclical ― On Care for
Our Common Home, Laudato Si’_

Did you know that, in 1800, Indiana had over 83% of its land area in forests? And by 1900,
forests made up less than 7% (Sam Carman, IDNR, Div. of Forestry)? Also, did you know some
city neighborhoods have few, if any trees? We urge you to take to heart Pope Francis’ wisdom
and his love for trees – and the blessings they give us.

One blessing is atmospheric oxygen to breathe by photosynthetic plants (e.g., trees) assimilating
carbon dioxide and water with sunlight. Other blessings are trees maintaining a constant air
temperature; and in cities, preventing the development of “heat islands.” Trees also provide
timber, paper and many other products.

Trees are also appreciated for their flowers, fruits, leaves, trunks and branches. They embellish
our lives with colors, smells and falling leaves. But trees are so much more! They’re our reliable
friends that protect humankind, animals and plants from wind, sleet, rain and snow. Trees also
provide habitat and shade, regulate climate, store nutrients (especially carbon), filter water,
protect and build soil, and reduce erosion (water conservation).

Trees make up different types of forests in the world, and 31 percent of the world’s land surface,
just over 4 billion hectares, is forested (Earth Policy Institute, 2012). Their numbers are
decreasing though from timbering, droughts, infestations and wildfires.

The removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is critically important because people emit
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere through their activities. For centuries, trees have offset these
carbon emissions. Saving Nature, Inc. (Carbon Footprint Calculator) says “it takes about 1,025
trees to offset the average American’s emissions today, with each tree absorbing about 31 lbs. of
carbon dioxide each year.” So, we need to preserve trees we have now and plant more.

Legislation like The Trillion Tree Act promotes the planting of more trees, and the management
and regeneration of these new trees (Ann Bartuska, 4/6/20, Resources Magazine). ForestIN plans
to plant a million trees in Indiana by 2025. Similarly, Carbon Neutral Indiana receives funds it
puts directly toward planting trees and managing forests. With such help, suitable tree species
will be planted and preserved forever. Please contact an arborist for help in planting trees!

Let’s look at trees – like Bob Ross – the late American painter. He said, &quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong
with having a tree as a friend.” In addition, children love naming trees at home because trees
have always been our friends. An excellent book on trees is “The Hidden Life of Trees – What
They Feel, How They Communicate,” by Peter Wohlleben.

In the future, let’s plan on planting and preserving more trees. God made our Earth green for a
reason; so let’s continue to be friends to trees.

Let’s keep things simple, empower and inspire ourselves to keep our Mother Earth as a green
world of trees, and promote other ecosystems like wetlands and prairies. Do what you can with
what you have, and reduce your carbon footprint by planting trees!
