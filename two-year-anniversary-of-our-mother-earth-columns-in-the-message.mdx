God made us stewards of His Planet Earth, and Pope Francis and others are spreading the message to treat Our
Mother Earth －like our mother, father, sister or brother. Let’s cherish our planet and its people, and maintain
the balance God originally created.

A beautiful quote from former President Jimmy Carter about people and the environment is, “I believe that
anyone can be successful in life, regardless of natural talent or the environment within which we live. This is
not based on measuring success by human competitiveness for wealth, possessions, influence, and fame, but
adhering to God&#39;s standards of truth, justice, humility, service, compassion, forgiveness, and love.”

In light of the Vatican’s peace and justice office inviting Catholic communities across the world to join a
grassroots movement in Care for Our Common Home, we believe Our Mother Earth columns are especially
valuable. The Vatican’s Action Platform focuses on …Catholic dioceses, religious orders, schools and
institutions committing to an ecological conversion and total sustainability. We hope these articles have and will
continue to educate and encourage good stewardship.

Our articles give readers ways to help planet Earth, that complement Laudato Si,’ especially during the Season
of Creation from September 1 (World day of Prayer) to October 4 (Feast of St. Francis of Assisi). As good and
faithful stewards, God calls us all to love and care for Our Mother Earth.

## What can we do? Consider on your property:

- Rethink, reuse and recycle
- Preserve and plant trees of proper species and location(s)
- Retain rainwater by increasing greenness
- Use renewable forms of energy
- Stop urban sprawl and promote groundwater recharge
- Plant gardens for pollinators
- Reduce your carbon footprint
- In farming, implement methods that hold water and reduce run-off using fewer chemicals
- Help save our natural resources

> “The earth will not continue to offer its harvest, except with faithful stewardship. We cannot say we love the
> land and then take steps to destroy it for use by future generations” - John Paul II.
