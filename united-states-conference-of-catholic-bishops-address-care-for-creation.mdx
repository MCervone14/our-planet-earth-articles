**Editor’s note:**
_This series takes a deeper look at Pope Francis’ 2015 encyclical ― On Care for Our Common
Home, Laudato Si’ and his 2021 Platform Goals._

Did you know the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee on Domestic Justice
and Human Development sent a letter to Congress on Budget Reconciliation and Climate
Change on June 8, 2022, supporting $555 billion in climate investments, $320 billion in clean-
energy tax credits, $20 billion in agricultural-conservation investments, and $105 billion
investments in resilience, such as wildfire-mitigation projects and forest preservation? The
USCCB also encouraged people of faith to take action, and contact elected representatives to
express their concerns and opinions on upcoming legislation. Such investments are needed to
meet the Paris Agreement goals to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030. Jose Aguto,
Executive Director of Catholic Climate Covenant says, “such actions will be a civilizational
game-changer.”

Within “Care for Creation,” the USCCB described how Pope Francis, Pope Benedict XVI and
St. John Paul II were instrumental in environmental reform. The USCCB also said, “We show
our respect for the Creator by our stewardship. Care for the earth is not just an Earth Day slogan,
it is a requirement of our faith. We are called to protect people and the planet, and to live our
faith in relationship with all of God’s creation. This challenge has fundamental moral and ethical
dimensions that cannot be ignored.” On June 15, 2001, the USCCB published Global Climate
Change: A Plea for Dialogue, Prudence and the Common Good. A noteworthy example of
climate change is featured in the article “As the Great Salt Lake Dries Up, Utah Faces an
Environmental Nuclear Bomb” (Christopher Favelle, 6/9/22, The New York Times).

On May 18, 2021, Bishop Robert McElroy of San Diego, California, presented a heartfelt speech
at a Catholic Climate Conference. His passionate words focused on the fragility of the planet and
how humankind is exploiting many places in the world – like the Amazon rainforest. He sounded
an alarm to stop climate change because it is our duty to our Creator and to future generations.
One powerful moment for him was when young people, in an accusatory way, pointed to him
and others on the Amazon Synod to do more. He offered the carbon tax as one method to reduce
carbon dioxide from the air. He said, “In the end of our lives, we want to see a world more
beautiful than how we received it,” and asked Catholics to speak with legislators; form groups to
educate others; and take action now.

On May 20, 2020, the USCCB had a “Laudato Si’” Roundtable that included Archbishop Paul
Coakley of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; then-auxiliary Bishop Robert Barron of Los Angeles,
California (now bishop of Winona-Rochester, Minnesota); and Bishop McElroy. The moderator
was Sister Marianne Comfort from the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas. This roundtable
addressed” Laudato Si’” questions such as:

- What was your most favorite phrase?
- How has the message been received?
- What most influenced Pope Francis?
- How does it invite Catholics?
- What have we learned?

Responses varied, but the consensus was that “Laudato Si’” is a wake-up call for humankind –
and that the planet will experience many deaths and illnesses in the future if we do not address
climate change now. How we respond to Pope Francis’ call makes all the difference in the world.
